  **Define** <br />
  - CPU: <br />
    CPU has surpassing processing power that operates the program and constantly ask users. <br />
  
  - Input Device: <br />
    Input device is device that gets input by people such as mouse and keyboard. <br />
  
  - Output Device: <br />
    Output device is device that shows outputed results such as screen and speaker. <br />
  
  - Main Memory: <br />
    Main Memory is volatile memory that is very fast and stores a small amount of information such as Ram. The memory disappears after the computer is shuted down. <br />
  
  - Auxiliary Memory: <br />
    Auxiliary Memory stores memory that doesn't get erased such as SSD and HDD. <br /><br />
  
  
  **Relation of each** <br />
  - In sequence, CPU ask -> people answer with programming -> saved in Auxiliary Memory -> computer change program in binary and understand -> computer answer <br /><br /><br />
    


- <ins>Python as an language</ins> <br /><br />
  **Syntax Error** <br />
  - As you do programming in python, you will encounter syntax error (grammer error in programming language) a lot. Programming language can only understand accurate content. <br /><br /><br />



- <ins>Reserved Word, Sequenctial, Conditional, and Repeated</ins> <br /><br />
  **Reserved Word and creating sentence** 
  - Reserved Word: <br />
    Reserved words are python's designated words that can't be used as the name of variable, function, and identifier. <br /><br>
    For example, <br>
    we can make variable like
    ``` python
    x = 2
    ``` 
    
    However, we can't make variable that starts with number or uppercase. Also we can't use python's designated names
    
    ``` python
    2jk = 2
    X = 2
    function = 2
    ```
